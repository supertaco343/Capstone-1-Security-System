This can be found by running the extra script, currently in 'teststuff.py', and finding your camera(s) in the list. \nTempPath: The path for the videomodule to save the temporary files at awaiting use by the main system, leave blank for the default choice of inside the directory in which the program is in. \nTempType: The file type the temp video will be saved as, make sure your camera will support that file type.  You can check this (and the supported resolution/frame rate for different types by running the command 'uvcdynctrl -f' in terminal. \nResolution: The resolution you wish the video to be saved/viewed as.  Make sure it is supported (like above). \nFrameRate: The frame rate at which the video can be recorded/viewed as.  Make sure it is supported (like above). \nTimeLimit: The max time (in seconds) that each temp video will be created as.  Smaller sizes (5-15 seconds) are recommended, larger sizes may increase memory and storage usage. \n")
