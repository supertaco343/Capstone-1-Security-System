# Project Timeline

### Week 1 (October 7th - 13th)
* Found a dataset that will be useful for identifying one of our desired events (deliveries). The [box dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/craig-test-workspace/doorbell-camera-alert) can be used to train an ai model that can detect a box in a live recording. The detection will then send a notification to the user, alerting them of the delivery.
